    // My name is jake smith - I am an avid outdoorsman with a passion for helping people
    // I want to use web development make tools that improve mental health and overall well-being
        
        // 1 - login and click on workouts

        // this app is called agisco
        // agisco is italian for I act
            // agisco workout manager
            // each workout is a collection of exercises, and each time you work out, your stats are tracked in a database

            // I built this application with JavaScript using:
                //axios, react, and vite to manage the front end,
                    //tailwind for styling
                //and express, PostGre SQL and Sequelize for the back end

// 2 - show workouts, goals, and preferences
            //one of the things that I am most proud of is the dynamic approach I took while structuring my react components
            // I designed this table component from scratch,
                // no matter how different a table might seem, 
                    // every table in this app is recycled using props and algorithms on the front and back ends to decide what fields to render

                    // workouts has 4 fields, one can be edited, just the name  
                        // create, edit, and delete a workout

// 3 - edit an exercise
            //dynamic approach to searching
                // row with indirect update to cardio

// 4 - edit a goal
            //show the search and that numbers will deny any letters 
            //search creator - admin
                // hip huggers and pull ups
        
// 5 - view a workout
            // add rowing to the workout

// 6 - edit a workout step

// 7 - run through a workout
            // share the problem with duplicate states

                // I spent a very long time designing the tables
                // if I did this again, I think I would separate the table components, 
                    // as I think I spent more time making them dynamic than it would have taken to make copies and separate them
                    // however, the process of keeping so many components mounted to the DOM 
                        //while only swapping what they dealt with, taught a ton effectively manage React State and asynchronous functions
                        // I also learned so much about how to construct an effective queries through sequelize and how to manage eager loading, M-M

                // now that I have used these 2 sprints to make a working product, I am excited to connect to a 
                            // free API I found through craig with hundreds of pre-made workouts, tutorials, and video and image resources
                            // additionally, I am excited to use the stored data points for charts, to track goals
                            // I also have a few tables in the background that haven't been implemented yet, 
                                // like preferences on metric or imperial, and dark mode
